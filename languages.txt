What is your favorite programming language? Why?

My favorite programming language is C++. provides close-to-hardware level control,
which enables efficient use of resources.  C++ supports object-oriented programming
principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. What's more, for me,
C++ can use some Linux command. 

Is your favorite language the one you are also most experienced with? If not, which language are you most experienced with?

To be honest, C++ is not my most experienced language, my most experienced
language is java. I am major in Computer Science.Since my first course is java
and my following courses are  alomost about java.
